# Classification Project**

**Project Objectives**
We here at TELCO Communicationsâ„¢ take customer satisfaction to heart. We are always looking to improve our customer's experience with our company. Today, we would like to explore the possible drivers of our customer churn rate. The following Jupyter Notebook offers in depth exploration, analysis, and models to project how drivers affect our customer experience and ultimate retention.

**Business Goals**
Identify drivers for customer churn at TELCO.
Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
create CSV file of these predictions.
Deliverables
a Jupyter Notebook Report showing process and analysis with the goal of finding drivers for customer churn.

a README.md file containing the project description with goals, a data dictionary, project planning, key findings, recommendations, and takeaways from your project.

a CSV file with customer_id, probability of churn, and prediction of churn. (1=churn, 0=not_churn)
individual modules, .py files, that hold your functions to acquire and prepare your data.

**Key Findings**:
* There appears to be a dependency on churn and month-to-month customer contracts.
* Month to month customers rate of churn higher than that of one-year contract customers
* Fiber customers have significantly higher monthly charges than customers without fiber octic.

# Reccomendations
- I would reccomend that the company should offer an incentive for customers on monnth-to-month contracts(especially those utilizing the fiber_optic) an incentive to either switch to a one year-plan or reduce prices for those customers on the month to month plans that have established some form of tenure with Telco.
